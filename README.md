# react-intermediate
Includes projects that I would categorise as medium/intermediate difficulty projects, built in React.js. Purpose: to get more accustomed with React fundamentals regarding hooks (useState, useContext, useEffect....) and custom hooks, calling APIs and dealing with data, integrating with simple Javascript-built backends and other FE tools/frameworks
